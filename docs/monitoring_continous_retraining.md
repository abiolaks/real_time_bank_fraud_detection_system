# üìä Step 5: Monitoring Dashboard & Continuous Improvement

## üéØ Objective
To build a **fraud monitoring dashboard** that allows bank analysts and data scientists to:
- Visualize real-time flagged transactions
- Track key fraud detection metrics
- Monitor model drift and system health
- Close the feedback loop by improving model accuracy continuously

---

## üß≠ 1. Why Monitoring Matters

Fraud patterns **evolve constantly** ‚Äî what looks normal today might be suspicious tomorrow.  
Without monitoring:
- Models become stale and inaccurate
- Fraudsters exploit blind spots
- Compliance and audit visibility are lost

Hence, continuous monitoring and retraining are **non-negotiable** for fraud systems.

## üí° 2. Monitoring Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Track Model Performance** | Monitor precision, recall, and F1 over time |
| **Detect Data Drift** | Identify shifts in user behavior or transaction patterns |
| **Alerting & Review** | Instantly flag and visualize high-risk transactions |
| **Retraining Feedback Loop** | Use verified labels to update and improve the model |

---

## üìà 3. Dashboard Features

The **Fraud Analytics Dashboard** (Streamlit or Power BI) displays both **real-time** and **historical insights**.

### üß© Core Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Overview Metrics** | Total transactions, % flagged as fraud, detection rate |
| **Fraud Alerts Table** | Real-time list of flagged transactions |
| **Model Performance Trends** | Line charts for precision, recall, and AUC over time |
| **Top Features (SHAP)** | Explainable AI visualization for feature importance |
| **Geographical View** | Map of high-risk regions or unusual locations |
| **Retraining Tracker** | Shows when last retraining occurred and model version |

## üíª 4. Example Streamlit Dashboard (Simplified)

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load logs
df = pd.read_csv("logs/transactions_log.csv")

st.set_page_config(page_title="Fraud Detection Dashboard", layout="wide")
st.title("üí≥ Fraud Detection Monitoring Dashboard")

# Overview Metrics
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
col1.metric("Total Transactions", len(df))
col2.metric("Flagged as Fraud", df[df['risk_level']=="High"].shape[0])
col3.metric("Detection Rate (%)", round(df[df['risk_level']=="High"].shape[0]/len(df)*100, 2))

# Fraud Probability Distribution
st.subheader("Fraud Probability Distribution")
fig = px.histogram(df, x="fraud_score", nbins=50, title="Distribution of Fraud Scores")
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

# Fraud Alerts Table
st.subheader("‚ö†Ô∏è High Risk Transactions")
high_risk = df[df["risk_level"]=="High"].sort_values(by="fraud_score", ascending=False)
st.dataframe(high_risk[["timestamp", "customer_id", "transaction_amount", "fraud_score", "risk_level"]])

# Geographical Distribution (optional)
if "location" in df.columns:
    st.subheader("üåç Fraud by Location")
    fig = px.scatter_geo(df, lat="lat", lon="lon", color="risk_level", hover_name="customer_id")
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)


üìä 5. Model Performance Tracking

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are calculated weekly or monthly from the test data and logged in a metrics file.

Metric	Description	Target
Recall	% of actual frauds detected	‚â• 90%
Precision	% of flagged frauds that are truly fraud	‚â• 70%
F1-score	Harmonic mean of precision & recall	‚â• 80%
AUC-ROC	Model‚Äôs discriminative ability	‚â• 0.90
False Positive Rate	Normal transactions flagged incorrectly	‚â§ 10%
import json
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score

metrics = {
    "precision": precision_score(y_test, y_pred),
    "recall": recall_score(y_test, y_pred),
    "f1": f1_score(y_test, y_pred),
    "auc": roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1])
}

with open("monitoring/metrics_log.json", "a") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(metrics) + "\n")

üìâ 6. Data & Concept Drift Detection

Over time, user behavior or transaction patterns may shift, reducing model accuracy.
To detect drift, compare new incoming data distribution with training data:

Drift Type	Description	Example
Data Drift	Input features change	More mobile vs. POS transactions
Concept Drift	Relationship between inputs and labels changes	Fraudsters change attack strategies
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metrics import DataDriftPreset

report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(reference_data=train_df, current_data=recent_df)
report.save_html("monitoring/data_drift_report.html")

üîÅ 7. Feedback & Continuous Learning Loop

Once flagged transactions are manually verified by fraud analysts:

The true labels (fraud or not fraud) are added to the logs.

These new samples are appended to the training dataset.

The retraining pipeline automatically triggers (e.g., weekly).

The new model is evaluated and deployed if it outperforms the old one.

Tools:

MLflow for tracking models

Airflow / Azure ML Pipelines for retraining automation

Git + CI/CD for model version control

üì¶ 8. Monitoring Artifacts

By the end of this phase, the POC provides:

‚úÖ An end-to-end fraud detection system ‚Äî from raw data to real-time inference.
‚úÖ A live monitoring dashboard ‚Äî for analysts and compliance teams.
‚úÖ Automated feedback & retraining loop ‚Äî ensuring continuous improvement.
