🏦 Step 8: End-to-End Architecture & POC Summary

This section provides a complete overview of the Bank Fraud Detection System — from data collection to model prediction, alerting, and monitoring.
It summarizes how each component fits together to deliver real-time fraud detection at scale.

🎯 Objectives

Present a unified view of the POC architecture.

Explain how data flows between each stage.

Show how machine learning, APIs, and monitoring tools integrate to create a full production-ready pipeline.

🧠 End-to-End Flow Overview

The system continuously learns from new transaction data and identifies anomalies that may represent fraud.
It consists of three layers:

Data Layer – Collects and stores raw and processed data

Model Layer – Prepares data, trains and deploys models

Application Layer – Serves predictions, alerts, and monitoring dashboards

🧩 1. Data Layer
Components:

Transaction Database: Stores all customer transactions (historical + new).
(Example: PostgreSQL, Azure SQL, or Cosmos DB)

Feature Store: Holds aggregated behavioral features per customer (7-day averages, new device flags, etc.).
(Example: Redis, Azure Feature Store, or simple Parquet tables)

Data Lake / Blob Storage: Stores logs, labeled data, and retraining datasets.

Responsibilities:

Maintain up-to-date customer transaction history.

Provide fast lookup for the inference pipeline.

Serve as input for periodic model retraining.

⚙️ 2. Model Layer
Components:

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Module

Cleans raw data and computes derived features (transaction patterns, anomalies).

Training Pipeline

Runs offline to train and validate fraud models.

Model Registry

Stores the best model with metadata (version, metrics, training date).

Inference Pipeline

Loads model in real time to score incoming transactions.

Model Type:

XGBoost or LightGBM trained on engineered features.

Output: Fraud probability (0.0 – 1.0)

🌐 3. Application Layer
Components:

FastAPI/Streamlit Service

Exposes /predict endpoint for real-time scoring.

Integrates with transaction system to intercept new transactions.

Alerting & Decision Engine

Flags transactions above fraud threshold.

Sends alerts to fraud team or blocks transactions instantly.

Monitoring & Retraining System

Tracks performance metrics, detects drift, and triggers automated retraining.

Tools: Evidently AI, MLflow, Azure Monitor, Airflow.
