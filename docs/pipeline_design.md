🧠 Step 6: Model Training, Evaluation & Pipeline Design

This stage focuses on building, evaluating, and operationalizing the fraud detection model.
It covers how we train the model, measure its performance, and design the pipelines (training and inference) that make the system production-ready.

🎯 Objectives

Train a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

Evaluate its performance using meaningful metrics.

Design automated pipelines for both model training and real-time fraud detection.

⚙️ Model Training Pipeline

This pipeline is used offline to build the fraud detection model from historical data.

🧩 Steps

Data Ingestion

Load historical transaction data from the database or data lake.

Preprocessing

Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Normalize numerical features.

Feature Engineering

Generate behavioral, contextual, and anomaly-based features (from Step 5).

Train/Test Split

Split data into training (e.g., 80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratification to preserve fraud ratios.

Model Selection

Test multiple algorithms:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest

XGBoost / LightGBM

Isolation Forest (for anomaly-based models)

Select the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate using:

Precision: Accuracy of fraud alerts.

Recall: How many frauds were detected.

F1-Score: Balance between Precision & Recall.

ROC-AUC: Overall discrimination power.

PR-AUC: Effective in imbalanced datasets.

Model Registry

Save the final model (e.g., fraud_model.pkl) for deployment.

Optionally track experiment metadata using MLflow or Azure ML.

🧮 Example Training Pipeline Code (Simplified)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score
import joblib

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)

# Train model
model = XGBClassifier(scale_pos_weight=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
preds = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, preds))
print("ROC-AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, preds))

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, "models/fraud_model.pkl")

⚡ Real-Time Inference Pipeline

Once trained, the model is deployed into a real-time system that detects fraud as transactions occur.

🧩 Steps

Receive a New Transaction

Triggered by API or message queue (e.g., Azure Event Hub, Kafka).

Fetch Customer History

Query database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB) for the user’s last 7–30 days of transactions.

Compute Features

Apply the same feature engineering logic used during training.

Load Trained Model

Load the model (fraud_model.pkl) from the model registry.

Predict Fraud Probability

Model outputs a score between 0 and 1.

Decision Threshold

If score > threshold (e.g., 0.7), classify as fraud.

Alert & Logging

Flag the transaction for review or block it automatically.

Log results for retraining and audit trail.

🧩 Example Inference Flow
def predict_fraud(transaction, model, feature_store):
    # Step 1: Fetch historical data for this customer
    history = feature_store.get_recent_transactions(transaction['customer_id'])
    
    # Step 2: Compute features
    features = compute_features(transaction, history)
    
    # Step 3: Predict fraud
    score = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
    
    return {"fraud_probability": score, "is_fraud": score > 0.7}

🔗 Why Pipeline Design Matters
Aspect	Purpose
Consistency	Ensures preprocessing & feature logic are identical in training and production
Automation	Eliminates manual steps; system reacts to new transactions instantly
Scalability	Supports high transaction volumes (millions/day)
Auditability	Logs allow tracking, retraining, and model performance monitoring
🧩 Summary of Pipelines
Pipeline Type	Purpose	Runs When	Output
Training Pipeline	Learn fraud patterns from historical data	Offline (batch)	Trained model
Inference Pipeline	Detect fraud in real-time	Online	Fraud score / alert
