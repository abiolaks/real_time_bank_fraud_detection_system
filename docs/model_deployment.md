# 🚀 Step 4: Model Deployment & Real-Time Inference Pipeline

## 🎯 Objective
To deploy the trained fraud detection model into a **real-time pipeline** capable of scoring incoming transactions and flagging suspicious ones instantly.

## ⚙️ 2. Key Pipeline Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Transaction Ingestion API** | Accepts live transaction data (JSON) from banking system |
| **Feature Lookup & Enrichment** | Retrieves recent customer history and computes behavioral stats |
| **Model Inference Layer** | Loads trained model (`fraud_model.pkl`) and predicts fraud probability |
| **Decision Engine** | Applies business rules to classify risk levels |
| **Data Store** | Logs transaction + predictions for monitoring and retraining |
| **Monitoring Dashboard** | Visualizes alerts, fraud scores, and system health |

---

## 📡 3. Real-Time Inference Workflow

### Example: ₦250,000 transaction from a new device at 2:00 AM

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Receive Request** | Transaction event is sent to the Fraud Detection API. |
| **2. Fetch User History** | System queries database for last 7–30 days of that customer’s activity. |
| **3. Compute Features** | Behavioral and risk features are computed on-the-fly. |
| **4. Run Model Inference** | Model predicts fraud probability (e.g., 0.87 = high risk). |
| **5. Decision Engine** | If `score > 0.8`, flag transaction and trigger alert. |
| **6. Log Results** | Store input features + prediction in database for retraining. |
| **7. Notify Analysts** | Alert is pushed to fraud monitoring dashboard for review. |

## 🧮 4. Example Inference API (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import pandas as pd
import joblib
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI(title="Fraud Detection API")
model = joblib.load("fraud_model.pkl")
feature_list = joblib.load("feature_list.json")

@app.post("/predict")
def predict_fraud(transaction: dict):
    try:
        # Convert input into dataframe
        df = pd.DataFrame([transaction])

        # Simulate feature enrichment (fetch recent user history)
        df["hour"] = datetime.now().hour
        df["is_weekend"] = datetime.now().weekday() >= 5
        df["amount_deviation"] = df["transaction_amount"] / (df.get("avg_txn_amount_7d", 1) + 1e-6)

        # Align features
        df = df.reindex(columns=feature_list, fill_value=0)

        # Predict probability
        prob = model.predict_proba(df)[:, 1][0]
        risk_level = "High" if prob > 0.8 else "Medium" if prob > 0.5 else "Low"

        # Log prediction (to DB / file)
        log_entry = {"customer_id": transaction["customer_id"], "prob": prob, "risk": risk_level}
        print(log_entry)

        return {"fraud_probability": float(prob), "risk_level": risk_level}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

POST /predict
{
  "customer_id": "C12345",
  "transaction_amount": 250000,
  "device_id": "new_device_99",
  "merchant_category": "electronics",
  "channel": "online"
}


{
  "fraud_probability": 0.87,
  "risk_level": "High"
}


🗃️ 5. Data Storage & Logging

Every scored transaction is logged for:

Retraining: Updating the model with recent patterns

Monitoring: Checking false positives & model drift

Auditability: Keeping records for compliance

Example log structure:

Field	Description
transaction_id	Unique transaction reference
customer_id	User identifier
transaction_amount	Transaction amount
fraud_score	Model output (0–1)
risk_level	Categorical risk
timestamp	Scoring time
label	(Later filled with true outcome: fraud/non-fraud)
📊 6. Monitoring & Feedback Loop

Monitoring ensures the model remains reliable over time.

Aspect	Tool/Method
Performance Drift	Track AUC, recall, precision weekly
Data Drift	Compare feature distributions with training data
Fraud Trend Visualization	Real-time dashboard (e.g., Streamlit, Power BI)
Retraining Trigger	When drift or accuracy threshold is breached
🔁 7. Model Retraining Pipeline

To keep the model up-to-date:

Collect new transactions + fraud outcomes weekly.

Append to the historical dataset.

Recompute behavioral features.

Retrain model automatically.

Validate, re-deploy if performance improves.

This can be automated via MLflow + Airflow + Azure ML pipelines or similar tools.

🚀 Step 7: Model Deployment & Monitoring

After training and validating the fraud detection model, the next phase focuses on deployment, real-time scoring, and continuous monitoring.
This ensures the model operates in production to detect fraud as transactions occur, and continues to improve over time.

🎯 Objectives

Deploy the trained model as a real-time API service.

Integrate it with the bank’s transaction system for live scoring.

Monitor model predictions, accuracy, and system performance.

Enable continuous learning and retraining when patterns evolve.

⚙️ Deployment Architecture Overview
🔹 1. Model Packaging

Export the trained model (fraud_model.pkl).

Include preprocessing and feature engineering scripts.

Bundle everything into a deployable container (e.g., Docker).

🔹 2. Model Hosting Options

Depending on the environment, the model can be deployed using:

Platform	Description	Example
Streamlit / FastAPI	Quick prototype with API endpoints	/predict endpoint
Azure ML Endpoint	Managed deployment with scaling	https://fraudapi.azurewebsites.net
AWS SageMaker / GCP Vertex AI	Cloud-native deployment options	—
On-Prem API Gateway	For internal bank systems	—
🔹 3. Inference Flow (Real-Time)

A new transaction request is sent to the API.

The API retrieves recent customer transactions (via a database lookup).

It applies the feature engineering pipeline.

The trained model scores the transaction.

The API returns a fraud probability and alert decision.

The transaction and prediction are logged for monitoring.

🧠 Example FastAPI Endpoint
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import joblib
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("models/fraud_model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict_fraud(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    features = compute_features(data)  # Apply feature logic
    prediction = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
    result = {
        "fraud_probability": float(prediction),
        "is_fraud": int(prediction > 0.7)
    }
    log_transaction(data, result)
    return result

📊 Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

Fraud patterns evolve, so monitoring ensures that the model stays reliable and up-to-date.

🔹 1. Model Performance Monitoring

Track key metrics over time:

Precision, Recall, and F1-score on recent transactions

False positive and false negative rates

Latency (prediction time per request)

Data drift (feature distribution changes)

Use tools like:

Evidently AI or WhyLabs for drift detection

Azure ML Monitoring or Prometheus/Grafana for metrics dashboard

🔹 2. Data Drift & Concept Drift

If fraudsters change their patterns, the model may degrade.

Detect drift using:

Statistical comparison of new data vs. training data

Performance drop in recent predictions

Trigger retraining if:

Data drift > threshold

Model accuracy < baseline

🔹 3. Model Retraining Loop

Establish a retraining schedule:

Weekly / Monthly retraining based on new labeled data.

Re-run the training pipeline automatically using orchestrators like:

Airflow

Azure Data Factory

MLflow Pipelines

🔹 4. Alerting System

If fraud probability > threshold:

Send real-time notification to fraud team dashboard.

Block transaction temporarily pending review.

Integration options:

Microsoft Teams or Email alert

Power BI dashboard for daily summaries

Log entries in centralized fraud detection database

Transaction Ingestion	Collect new transactions	Event Hub / Kafka
Prediction	Run inference	FastAPI / Azure ML
Logging	Store predictions	Blob Storage / SQL
Monitoring	Track drift & accuracy	Evidently AI / Azure ML
Retraining	Refresh model	Airflow / MLflow pipeline
