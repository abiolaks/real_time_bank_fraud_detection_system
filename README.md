# Bank Fraud Detection Model – POC
## Overview

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how a Machine Learning–powered Fraud Detection System can help banks identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions in real time.

The goal is to reduce financial losses, protect customers, and enhance trust by automating fraud flagging based on transaction and behavioral data.

## Problem Statement

Banks face millions of transactions daily — making manual fraud detection impractical and slow.
Traditional rule-based systems (like “flag if transaction > ₦500,000”) are static and easy to bypass.

Fraudsters evolve quickly, using sophisticated techniques such as:

Identity theft

Account takeover

Device manipulation

Unusual transaction patterns

The challenge is to build a system that can learn user behavior and detect anomalies dynamically — even as new fraud patterns emerge.

# What the Model Solves

The ML-based model automatically:

Learns normal behavioral patterns for each customer.

Detects deviations in new transactions that may indicate fraud.

Flags or scores each transaction as legitimate or suspicious.

This replaces manual or static rules with data-driven intelligence.

# How the Model Works
### 1. Training Phase

During model training, we use historical transaction data that includes both legitimate and fraudulent cases.

Each transaction contains:

* Customer ID

* Transaction amount, type, timestamp

* Device ID, channel (ATM, POS, online)

* Location data

* Historical label (fraud / not fraud)

The model learns behavioral patterns such as:

Typical spending times

Common merchant categories

Usual devices and geolocations

Frequency and transaction sizes

This allows the model to understand each customer’s unique “normal” behavior profile.

### 2. Inference (Prediction) Phase

When a new transaction arrives (e.g., ₦250,000 at 2 AM from a new device), the system performs the following steps:

* Fetch Customer History

An API or database query retrieves the recent historical transactions for that customer.

Typically, it fetches data from the past 30–90 days, enough to represent their latest behavior.

This lookup is done only for the customer involved in the new transaction.

* Compute Behavioral Features

From the fetched history, the system computes real-time behavioral features, such as:

Average transaction amount

Frequency of transactions per day/week

Common transaction times (e.g., daytime vs midnight)

Most used device or channel

Geographical distance from last transaction

These computed features are then combined with details of the new transaction.

c. Predict Fraud Risk

The enriched feature vector is passed to the trained model.
The model outputs a fraud score or binary label (fraudulent / not fraudulent).

d. Log + Update

After prediction, the system logs:

The new transaction record

The computed behavioral features

The model’s fraud score

This record is stored in the transaction database for:

Continuous learning

Model retraining

Audit trail and analysis

## Architecture Summary

1. Data Sources

Transaction database (historical + live feed)

Customer profile database

Device/channel metadata

2. Processing Pipeline

Feature store for behavioral computation

Model inference API

Logging and analytics store

3. Components

Component	Function
Feature Engineering	Extract real-time behavioral and transactional features
Model Inference API	Predicts fraud score for each new transaction
Database Lookup	Fetches recent customer transaction history (past 30–90 days)
Logging Module	Stores computed features + model prediction
Dashboard (optional)	Displays flagged transactions and fraud alerts
## Example Flow

Step 1: New transaction from Customer C1021 → ₦250,000 at 2 AM
Step 2: System fetches past 30 days of C1021’s transactions
Step 3: Computes behavior features (avg spend ₦10,000, typical time = 8 AM–6 PM)
Step 4: Model detects anomaly → outputs fraud score 0.92
Step 5: Transaction is flagged and stored for audit

## Advantages of Using Machine Learning
Advantage	Description
Adaptive	Learns new fraud trends dynamically from data
Behavior-Aware	Understands each customer’s unique spending pattern
Real-Time Detection	Flags fraud within milliseconds of transaction
Reduced False Positives	More accurate than rigid rule-based systems
Scalable	Works across millions of transactions simultaneously
## Next Steps for the POC

Generate or use historical transaction data for model training.

Engineer behavioral and transactional features.

Train ML model (e.g., XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Neural Net).

Build real-time inference pipeline and feature store.

Log and visualize suspicious transactions.

## Outcome

A working fraud detection POC that can:

Identify risky transactions in real time

Adapt to customer behaviors

Provide explainable fraud reasoning

Reduce financial losses and operational risks
